    <h2>Receiving email from this domain?</h2>
    <p>
        <small>Only the domain paulhefford.com (not including subdomains) is used to send email,
            however all the domains I own publish <abbr title="Sender Policy Framework"><a href="http://www.openspf.org/">SPF</a></abbr>,
            <abbr title="DomainKeys Identified Mail"><a href="http://www.dkim.org/">DKIM</a></abbr>
            and <abbr title="Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance"><a href="http://www.dmarc.org/">DMARC</a></abbr>
            records in <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> so the source of email can be verified.
            Any email which appears to be sent from the domain paulhefford.com is expected to pass both SPF and DKIM tests as
            per the DMARC policy. If either of these tests does not pass, the email should be rejected as it
            did not originate from an authorised source.</small>
    </p>
    <p>
            <small>Many email systems as well as large email providers such as Google,
            Yahoo! and Microsoft incorporate the checks mentioned above into their spam detection rules, so no explicit recipient action
            is normally required. Unfortunately, because the sender address of an email can easily be forged, I cannot prevent unauthorised
            emails from being sent. By publishing the aforementioned email validation information, recipients are able to
            quickly and unobtrusively validate email which is apparently sent from my domains.</small>
